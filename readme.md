#Ten a Day

## Command Line App for setting short 10 minute timers for tasks

### Ideally used for tasks that you want to get a minimal amount of time in per day

### Run `g++ tenaday.cpp` then run the exe file

## Todo

1. Add timer
2. Add fstream functionality to include new tasks
3. Add a way to check off tasks completed
